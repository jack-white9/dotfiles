# dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles that I use for macOS development, including vim (neovim + nvchad), starship, and zsh (oh-my-zsh).

## Prerequisites

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) (**optional:** [enable natural text editing](https://gist.github.com/seachai/948ed1eeafa32ce03db6685edb879f71))
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/installing/)

## Installation

To install, run the following command from the repository root:

```shell
chmod +x ./bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```
